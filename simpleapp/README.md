Here's a README file for a Docker Compose project that sets up a CakePHP working environment:

```markdown
# CakePHP Docker Compose Project

This project uses Docker Compose to set up a working environment for a CakePHP application. The setup includes services for the web server, PHP

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed on your machine.
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed on your machine.


## Project Structure

Here is the basic structure of the project:

```plaintext
.
├── docker-compose.yml
├── Dockerfile
├── docker
    └── (scripts)
└── html/my_app
    └── (CakePHP generated application files)
```

## Usage

1. Launch Docker Compose:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```

## Accessing the Application

Once the containers are running, you can access the CakePHP application in your web browser at `http://localhost:8765`.

## Stopping the Containers

To stop the containers, use the command:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

This command stops and removes the containers, networks, and volumes defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
